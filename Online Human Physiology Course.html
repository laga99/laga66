<b>LAGA66 |&nbsp;</b>Human physiology is the mechanical, physical, and biochemical science of healthy human functions, their organs, and the cells they compose. The main level of focus of physiology is at the organ and system level [1]. Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to aspects related to animal physiology, and animal experiments have provided many of the basic physiological knowledge. Anatomy and physiology are closely related to the field of study: anatomy, the study of form, and physiology, study of functions, are intrinsically bound and studied together as part of the medical curriculum [1].</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
1. Organ System</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Traditionally, the academic discipline of physiology views the body as a collection of interacting systems, each with its own combination and its own function and purpose. Every body system contributes to the homeostasis of other systems of all organisms. No body system works alone, and people's health depends on the health of all body systems interacting</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
2.Integration, communication and Homeostasis</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The basic biological study of physiology, integration refers to the overlapping function of many systems of the human body, as well as the accompanied form. This is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electricity and chemistry. In terms of the human body, the endocrine and nervous system play a major role in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate functions. Homeostasis is a major aspect of interaction within an organism, including humans.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
3. Homeostatic Concept</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The word homeostasis refers to the maintenance of overall endurance in the body. Homeostasis stabilizes the body by regulating the internal environment. It takes the body to function as it should be. The homeostatic process is essential for the survival of every cell, tissue, and body system [2]. Homeostasis in the general sense refers to stability, balance or equilibrium. Maintenance of a stable internal environment requires constant monitoring, especially by the brain and nervous system. The brain receives information from the body and responds appropriately through the release of various substances such as neurotransmitters, catecholamines, and hormones [2]. The physiology of individual organs is furthermore useful to facilitate the maintenance of homeostasis from the whole body eg Arrangement of blood pressure: the release of renin by the kidneys which allows the blood pressure to be stable (Renin, angiotensinogen protein, Aldosterone System), although the brain helps regulate blood pressure by pituitary hormones by releasing Anti-diuretic (ADH). Thus, homeostasis is maintained in the body as a whole, depending on the parts</div>

4.History</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The study of human physiology at least back to 420 BC and also in the days of Hippocrates, the father of medicine [4]. Aristotle's critical thought and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the early journey of physiology in Ancient Greece, while Claudius Galenus (126-199 AD), known as Galen, was the first to use experiments to investigate bodily functions. Galen was the founder of experimental physiology [5] in the medical world moved from Galenism only to the appearances of Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey. [6]</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
During the Middle Ages, the ancient traditions of Greek and Indian medicine have been further developed by Muslim doctors. The important work in this period was done by Ibn Sina (980-1037), author of The Canon of Medicine, and Ibn al-Nafis (1213-1288), among others.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
After the Middle Ages, the Renaissance brought about an increase in physiological research in the Western world that sparked the study of modern anatomy and physiology. Andreas Vesalius is the author of one of the most influential books on human anatomy, De humani corporis fabrica [7]. Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy. [8] The anatomist William Harvey describes the circulatory system in the 17th century, [9] demonstrating a useful combination of close observation and careful experimentation to learn about bodily functions, which is fundamental to the development of experimental physiology. Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as the father of physiology for being a Leiden teacher and a book because of his text, Institutiones medicae (1708).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the 18th century, important works in this field were developed and researched by Pierre Cabanis, a French physician and physiologist.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to develop at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 theories of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. It radically states that the organism is made up of units called cells. (1813-1878) Claude Bernard invented a further theory, which ultimately conceived his concept of the interieur environment, which would then be adopted and fought as "homeostasis" by American physiologist Walter Cannon (1871-1945).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human functions, eventually spawning the field of physiology and comparative ecophysiology [10]. Major figures in this field include Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew. More recently, evolutionary physiology has been a distinct subdiscipline. [11]</div>
